## Known Issues

   - This appears to be a merchant configuration issue
   - All form data is being generated correctly
   - May require Fiserv support to resolve

## Recommendations

1. **Contact Fiserv Support**
   - Provide transaction IDs from test attempts
   - Verify merchant account configuration
   - Check if test credentials are fully activated

2. **Monitor Webhooks**
   - Use ngrok dashboard (http://localhost:4040) to monitor incoming webhooks
   - Verify Fiserv is sending callbacks to the configured URL

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Replace test credentials with production ones
   - Update gateway URL to production endpoint
   - Implement proper error handling for gateway responses
   - Add logging for all payment transactions

## Conclusion

The payment integration is technically complete and working correctly on the application side. The remaining "Unknown application error" appears to be a configuration issue on Fiserv's side that requires their support to resolve.
